    <h2>Internet Safety</h2>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>Online Privacy</h3>
        <p>
            Online privacy means protecting your personal information while using the internet. 
            This includes your full name, address, school name, passwords, and photos. 
            You should avoid sharing private details with strangers or on public platforms. 
            Even small pieces of information can be combined to reveal more than you expect, so it is important to think carefully before posting anything online.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>Strong Passwords</h3>
        <p>
            Strong passwords help keep your accounts secure from hackers. 
            A good password includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. 
            It should not contain personal information like your birthday or name. 
            Using different passwords for different accounts adds another layer of protection and keeps your information safer.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>Digital Footprints</h3>
        <p>
            A digital footprint is the record of everything you do online. 
            Posts, comments, shared photos, and even likes contribute to your digital history. 
            Even if something is deleted, it may still exist somewhere online. 
            Because colleges, teachers, and future employers may view online activity, it is important to maintain a respectful and responsible digital presence.

    <h2>Smart Research Skills</h2>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>How to Tell if a Website is Trustworthy</h3>
        <p>
            A trustworthy website clearly explains who created it and provides accurate, up-to-date information. 
            Reliable sites often use domains such as .edu, .gov, or .org. 
            They include references or sources to support their claims. 
            Websites with excessive advertisements, poor grammar, or dramatic language should be reviewed carefully before being used for school research.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>Why the Creator of a Website Matters</h3>
        <p>
            The credibility of a website depends on who created it. 
            Information written by experts, teachers, or official organizations is generally more reliable. 
            If the author is not listed or their qualifications are unclear, the content may not be trustworthy. 
            Always consider the source before using information in academic work.
        </p>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>Why the Purpose of a Website Matters</h3>
        <p>
            Websites are created for different purposes. Some aim to educate, while others are designed to sell products or promote opinions. 
            If a website’s main goal is advertising or persuasion, the information may be biased. 
            For school assignments, it is best to choose websites that focus on factual information and education.

    <div class="card">
        <h3>When a Website Should Not Be Used for School Research</h3>
        <p>
            A website should not be used if it lacks an author, publication date, or reliable sources. 
            Sites filled with extreme opinions, emotional arguments, or unsupported claims are not appropriate for academic research. 
            It is important to compare information with other trusted sources before including it in your work.

    <div class="info-box">
